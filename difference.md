# The explanation of the differences in the results we get from SPSS and Python.

## 3a). The bar charts produced by SPSS and Python are slightly different.
- **Different settings or parameters**: they may have different default Settings for the size and orientation of the chart, the color and style of the bar chart, and the labels and markers on the axis. Differences in these Settings and parameters can cause the bar charts to look slightly different, even if they are based on the same data.
- **Algorithm Difference**: SPSS is a proprietary package, so it uses its own proprietary algorithms, whereas Python relies on a variety of open source libraries and frameworks to generate bar graphs. This means that the specific algorithms used by SPSS and Python to create the bar graph may differ, which may result in slightly different visualizations.


## 4b). The difference of standardized coefficients.
- **Outliers**: If the data used in a regression analysis contains outliers, these outliers can affect the calculations used to determine the standardized coefficients. For example, if an outlier is present in the data for a predictor variable, it can cause the correlation between that predictor and the response variable to be higher or lower than it would be without the outlier. So, if SPSS and Python use different methods for dealing with outliers in the data, it could result in the two tools producing slightly different results when analyzing the same dataset. 


## 6). logit regression.
- **Missing Values**: we used Python to ignore missing values in the data, this means that the missing values will not be included in the analysis, and the coefficients and other results will be based only on the non-missing data. On the other hand, SPSS may use a different method for dealing with missing values, such as imputing the missing values using a specific algorithm, the results produced by the two differen method could be slightly different.
