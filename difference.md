# The explanation of the differences in the results we get from SPSS and Python.

## 3a). The bar charts produced by SPSS and Python are slightly different.
- Different settings or parameters: they may have different default Settings for the size and orientation of the chart, the color and style of the bar chart, and the labels and markers on the axis. Differences in these Settings and parameters can cause the bar charts to look slightly different, even if they are based on the same data.
- Algorithm Difference : SPSS is a proprietary package, so it uses its own proprietary algorithms, whereas Python relies on a variety of open source libraries and frameworks to generate bar graphs. This means that the specific algorithms used by SPSS and Python to create the bar graph may differ, which may result in slightly different visualizations.
